# microbit-export

Export/render microbit blocks as vector graphics. [Try it out](https://gurtt.github.io/microbit-export/)!

## Usage

In the micro:bit workspace, switch to the JavaScript view by clicking the button at the top of the page. Then, paste the relevant code into the renderer and hit the button. A preview is shown on-screen, and the image is available for download as an SVG.

The renderer supports multiple code blocks. Multiple blocks will be rendered as a single image file; render single sections at a time for multiple images.

This project is inspired by [Scratchblocks](https://github.com/scratchblocks/scratchblocks), a similar project for rendering Scratch block groups. Details for the MakeCode rendering engine can be found [here](https://makecode.microbit.org/blocks-embed).
